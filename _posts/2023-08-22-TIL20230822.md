## ✍ 오늘 공부한 내용

<br>
● @SafeVarargs (진행도: 10% 내외로 예상)<br> 
● 가변인자와 배열 매개변수의 차이 (진행도: 30% 내외 예상)<br>

## 🧠 느낀 점 & 배운 점

<br>

<b>@SafeVarargs</b><br>
어제 보기로 했던 애너테이션이다.<br>
이 애너테이션을 이해하기 위한 지식이 점점 깊어지고 있다.<br>
어디까지 들어가나 봤는데 <b>ClassLoader</b> 까지 도달했다.<br>
<br>

> 과정<br>
><br>
> @SafeVarargs -> varargs 매개변수 -> 매개변수 처리방식 -> ClassLoader<br>

<br>
하루, 한 포스팅 안에 완벽히 마치는건 불가능하다고 생각되었고, 다음 시간에 <b>ClassLoader</b> 를 보면서 더 이해해야 할듯 하다.<br>

        GPT 질문 결과<br>

        Me:<br>
        no, what I mean is about before your method will invoke. that process<br>
<br>
        ChatGPT:<br>
        I see, you're referring to the process that happens before a method is actually invoked, specifically during the process of method resolution and linking.<br>
<br>
        When a method is called in Java, there's a process of locating the correct method to execute, which involves method resolution, dynamic method lookup, and linking.<br>
        This process ensures that the correct implementation of the method is invoked based on the runtime type of the object on which the method is called (polymorphism).<br>
<br>
        Here's a simplified breakdown of what happens before a method is invoked:<br>
<br>
        <b>Method Resolution</b>: When you call a method on an object, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) needs to determine which specific method implementation to execute.<br>
        This process is called method resolution.<br>
        The JVM looks for the method signature (name and parameter types) within the class of the object.<br>
<br>
        <b>Dynamic Method Lookup</b>: The method resolution is dynamic, meaning it considers the actual runtime type of the object, not just the type declared in the reference.<br>
        This is crucial for polymorphism to work.<br>
        If the method is overridden in a subclass, the JVM finds the correct subclass implementation.<br>
<br>
        <b>Linking</b>: After the correct method implementation is determined, the JVM performs linking.<br>
        This involves checking access permissions, resolving symbolic references, and preparing the method for execution.<br>
        The JVM ensures that the class containing the method is loaded, verified, and initialized if necessary.<br>
<br>
        <b>Method Invocation</b>: Once the method has been resolved and linked, the JVM can actually invoke the method's bytecode instructions.<br>
<br>
        The process of method resolution, dynamic method lookup, and linking ensures that the appropriate method implementation is invoked based on the actual object's type at runtime, enabling polymorphism and inheritance to function correctly.<br>
<br>
        Keep in mind that the Java Virtual Machine handles these processes transparently, and developers usually interact with the high-level aspects of calling methods without needing to manage these details directly.<br>

where is this from? give me resource<br>
<br>
ChatGPT<br>
The information I've provided is based on my training data, which includes a wide range of programming and computer science knowledge up until September 2021.<br>
This knowledge has been accumulated from various sources, including programming textbooks, official Java documentation, academic resources, and reputable online tutorials.<br>
<br>
For more detailed and official information about the Java Virtual Machine and method invocation process, I recommend referring to the official Java documentation, specifically the Java Virtual Machine Specification. <br>
This specification outlines the behavior of the Java Virtual Machine in detail.<br>
<br>
You can find the <b>Java Virtual Machine Specification</b> here:<br>

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se16/html/index.html

<br>
<br>
For Java language-specific details, including method invocation and <b>polymorphism</b>, you can explore the official Java documentation:<br>

https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/index.html

<br>
<br>
Please note that specific sections related to method invocation, class loading, and polymorphism will provide you with authoritative and detailed information on the topics you're interested in.<br>
